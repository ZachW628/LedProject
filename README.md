# LedProject
Led matrix project

Current Progress as of 8/3/17
   All charcaters have been made and numbers but no special characters.
   Characters are currently working with the wiring Pi library.
   Character list that moves strings accross the board is complete.
   Imporved performance able to toggle 8 LEDS at once instead of 1 using my library instead of wiring pi
   
 Things to do still:
    All the characters need to be fixed so they use my library to interact with the mcp23017 instead of wiring pi
